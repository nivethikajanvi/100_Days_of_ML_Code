Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations.  
Covers all topics in a first year college linear algebra course. 
This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus 
(although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.
